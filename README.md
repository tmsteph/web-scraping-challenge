# Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars
### ####---Barely finished in time. I'll be updating and organizing as I go! -----#####
Wow! I'm still updating because this was such a fun project.

We were assigned with making a full web scraping and display application using BeautifulSoup, splinter, and personally Google's Chrome Driver to collect information from the NASA's website. I stored this information in A Mongo Database in order to use flask to display the information live to a webpage. 

Check out the jupyter notebook for how I went about collecting the data!
