# Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars

Wow! I'm still updating because this was such a fun project. I was barely able to get it to work so I'll be improving and editing as it goes. 

We were assigned with making a full web scraping and display application using BeautifulSoup, splinter, and Google's Chrome Driver to collect information from the NASA's website. I stored this information in A Mongo Database in order to use flask to display the information live to a webpage. 

Check out the jupyter notebook for how I went about collecting the data!
